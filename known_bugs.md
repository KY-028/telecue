## Known Bugs

### Script Settings Not Saved

If you navigate away from the script settings page, the settings are not saved.
E.g. tap Recent Scripts > tap a script > change settings > tap Recent Scripts > tap the same script > settings are not saved

### Concurrent Transcription + Recording

If you hit Record first, then tap the Auto AI Mode, your recording will be cut off the moment you switch to AI Mode. It is not an issue if it's the other way around (tap the Auto AI Mode first, then hit Record).

### Progress bar fail to progress for web

The progress bar fail to display the current progress of the script for web. It is not an issue for mobile.

### Inaccurate Try/Catch Behaviour when the user is on a call and press record

When the user is on a call and press record, the try/catch block will not catch the error. However, the app is still functional, just that you have to press "Dismiss" for each error that pops up.
